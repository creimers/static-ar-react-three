# static ar scene with React and three.js

This repository exists so I can share my camera [configuration challenge](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/creimers/static-ar-react-three/tree/csb-1579817435266/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FARScene%2Findex.jsx&theme=dark).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
